            <div class="card">
            <div class="hidden-content">
            <p>ORCAS (Oil Recovery Clean-Up Automated System) is an AI-powered, eco-friendly oil spill cleanup system that uses innovative filtration and automated technology.  The global demand for oil has led to increased oil transportation by sea, making oil spills a persistent environmental hazard, particularly in maritime nations like the Philippines and Japan. Traditional oil spill cleanup methods such as mechanical recovery, chemical dispersants, and burning are often inefficient, hazardous, and leave substantial oil residues, causing lasting environmental harm.  <br>
                To address these challenges, ORCAS offers an innovative solution by combining automation, AI, and eco-friendly materials for a more effective and sustainable cleanup. ORCAS integrates an ocean vacuum with coconut-mica filters that maximize oil absorption and minimize water intake, outperforming conventional sorbents and significantly reducing pollution. Powered by AI, ORCAS autonomously maps, navigates, and performs spill cleanup operations with minimal human intervention, ensuring real-time monitoring and enhanced efficiency. <br>
                With its use of biodegradable coconut husks and mica minerals, ORCASâ€™s filtration system is both reusable and environmentally friendly. The AI-driven mapping, targeted suction, and sustainable filtration approach position ORCAS as a scalable and efficient solution for oil spill response, advancing marine conservation and sustainability efforts.</p><br><br>

            <div class="hidden-content">
            <p>As the global demand for oil-based products rises, the rate of oil being transported rises as well. Oil workers and vessels are often exposed to hazardous chemicals and dangerous situations, despite ongoing technological advances, traditional oil spill cleanup methods remain inefficient, labor-intensive, time-consuming, and dangerous. To revolutionize oil spill cleanup through automation and advanced filtration technology, our startup was founded with the vision of creating a more efficient, sustainable, and safer solution. <br>
                ORCAS integrates cutting-edge technology, geo-tracking, and eco-friendly filtration to lessen the risk of human workers in risky situations. This innovative approach fills a gap in the market by offering a scalable, sustainable, and highly effective solution to the growing threat of oil spills worldwide. ORCAS with its subsystems represents a significant leap forward, addressing the inefficiencies of current methods and setting a new standard for environmental protection and disaster response.</p><br><br>
