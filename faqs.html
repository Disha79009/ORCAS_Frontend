        <div class="faq-container">

            <!-- FAQ 1 -->
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">1. How is ORCAS different from traditional oil spill cleanup methods?</p>
                <button class="read-answer-btn">Read Answer</button>
                <p class="faq-answer">ORCAS automates the oil spill cleanup process by using advanced mapping, automated navigation and eco-friendly filteration , reducing human involvement and improving oil recovery efficiency. Unlike traditional labour intensive methods that rely on booms and dispersants, ORCAS operates autonomously and sustainably, minimizing environmental impact.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- FAQ 2 -->
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">2. How does ORCAS locate and target oil spills?</p>
                <button class="read-answer-btn">Read Answer</button>
                <p class="faq-answer">ORCAS is equipped with advanced sensors and geo-tracking technology and uses machine learning algorithms that map and detect oil spills zones in real time. The AI-driven mapping pinpoints high oil concentration areas, adapting to spill spread and depth and then deploys automated cleanup units to the affected area, ensuring efficient containment and precise removal or clean-up.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- FAQ 3 -->
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">3. What makes ORCASâ€™s suction system different from traditional vacuums?</p>
                <button class="read-answer-btn">Read Answer</button>
                <p class="faq-answer"> Traditional Oil spill vacuums often collect significant amounts of water along with oil. ORCAS's suction mechanism focuses specifically on high oil concentration zones, guided by its mapping data. Unlike traditional vacuum systems that remove both oil and water, ORCAS features a specialized filtration mechanism that separates oil from water, maximizing oil recovery while minimizing waste and reducing operational costs.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- FAQ 4 -->
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">4. What benefits does ORCAS offer to coastal communities and the marine industry?</p>
                <button class="read-answer-btn">Read Answer</button>
                <p class="faq-answer">ORCAS helps protect marine life, preserves fishing industries, and supports local economies by minimizing the long-term damage caused by oil spills. It also reduces cleanup costs and response times. ORCAS's efficient oil recovery process minimizes oil losses, reduces environmental damage, and supports marine biodiversity. By, automating cleanup operations, ORCAS also reduces operational costs and, health risks for workers, fostering economic growth in coastal communities and improving marine disaster response.  </p>
            </div>

            <!-- FAQ 5 -->
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">5. Can ORCAS be used in various marine environments?</p>
                <button class="read-answer-btn">Read Answer</button>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes, ORCAS is designed to adapt to different marine conditions, including coastal areas, open seas, and industrial ports, making it a versatile solution for oil spill response. ORCAS is designed for scalability and adaptability, making it suitable for diverse marine conditions, from coastal areas to open sea The autonomous System continuously adjusts, its operations in real-time, ensuring effective cleanup even in dynamic or harsh marine environments. </p>
            </div>

            <!-- FAQ 6 -->
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">6. How does ORCAS minimize human risk during cleanup operations?</p>
                <button class="read-answer-btn">Read Answer</button>
                <p class="faq-answer">By automating the oil spill cleanup process, ORCAS eliminates the need for workers to operate in hazardous conditions, reducing exposure to toxic substances and improving safety for cleanup crews. ORCAS's autonomous central control system allows it to navigate and operate with minimal, human intervention. This reduces the need for workers to be in hazardious conditions, enhancing safety while ensuring effective cleanup in challenging marine environments. </p>
